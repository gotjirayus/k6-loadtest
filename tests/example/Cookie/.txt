HTTP Cookies are used by web sites and apps to store pieces of stateful information on the user's device. A server tells the client, 
via a Set-Cookie HTTP header, what information it wants to be stored on the user's machine.

The user's browser will store the cookie data and associate it with the hostname of the server, 
and for each subsequent request to that hostname, it will include the stored cookie data in a Cookie header.
