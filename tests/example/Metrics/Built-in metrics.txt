METRIC NAME                 TYPE                DESCRIPTION
vus                         Gauge               Current number of active virtual users
vus_max                     Gauge               Max possible number of virtual users (VU resources are preallocated, to ensure performance will not be affected when scaling up the load level)
iterations                  Counter             The aggregate number of times the VUs in the test have executed the JS script (the default function).       
iteration_duration          Trend               The time it took to complete one full iteration of the default/main function.
dropped_iterations          Counter             the number of iterations that could not be started due to lack of VUs (for the arrival-rate executors) or lack of time (due to expired maxDuration in the iteration-based executors).
data_received               Counter             The amount of received data.
data_sent                   Counter             The amount of data sent.    
checks	                    Rate	            The rate of successful checks.
